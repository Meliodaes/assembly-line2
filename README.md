# Assembly Line²
Assembly Line² is an unofficial port of the mobile game Assembly Line (made with heart and HTML).  
This port keeps orignal "mind" of the game, with some adjustments. _(keep in mind that it's a WIP)_

### Actual State :
Starting the overlay, with "build" menu.

### RoadMap :
##### April :
- [x] HTML / JS base (100%)
- [ ] 'Overlaying' (10%)
- [ ] Add ressources tiles (and "Starter" if possible)
##### May :
- [ ] Move structures (and rotate)
- [ ] Remove structures
- [ ] Some blueprints !
