# Assembly Line²
Assembly Line² ia an unofficial port of the mobile game Assembly Line (made with heart and HTML).
This port keeps orignal "mind" of the game, with some adjustments. _(keep in mind that it's in WIP)_

### Actual State :
Currently, I need to structure HTML code and start building "core" system in JS.

### RoadMap :
##### April :
- [ ] HTML / JS base
- [ ] 'Overlaying'
- [ ] Add ressources tiles (and "Starter" if possible)
##### May :
- [ ] Move structures (and rotate)
- [ ] Remove structures
- [ ] Some blueprints !
