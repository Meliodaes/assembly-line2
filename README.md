# Assembly Line²
Assembly Line² is an unofficial port of the mobile game Assembly Line.  
This port keeps orignal "mind" of the game, with some adjustments and new things.  

### Actual State :
**New :** Resource spawning and cycle management for "Starter" (every 3 seconds each starter use 5$ to work)  
You can "play" demo here : [Assembly Line²](https://swncake.github.io/assembly-line2/index.html)  

### Known Issues :
- Bug with resources when there are more than one starter  
- Bug with resources when many resources come to "Seller"  
- Overlay built only for 1920x1080 screen
